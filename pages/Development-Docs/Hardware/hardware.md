# Hardware Docs

This section is dedicated to detailing the hardware used to interface with the simulation. The below links will help to navigate this section. We recommend starting at setup and then going to rotary encoders/trinkeys. Once you are familiar with the current setup, future development ideas have been placed in the respective section.

- [Setup](setup.md)
- [Future Development](future-development.md)
- [Rotary Encoders/Trinkeys](rotary-encoders/setup.md)
