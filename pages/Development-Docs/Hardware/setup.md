# Hardware Setup

Most of this is described in the user docs [here](../../User-Docs/setup.md). This will expand on some additional things.

## Trinkey Setup

For the trinkeys, please look at [Trinkey Setup](rotary-encoders/setup.md). Ultimately, code will need to be uploaded to the trinkeys to mimic a keyboard. The keyboard inputs are then mapped to different events within the simulation. 

Once code is uploaded, it is a simple matter of connecting the trinkeys to the computer via USB cables. Originally, a USB hub hosted all of the trinkeys, and the hub was then connected to the computer to reduce the usage of USB ports on the computer.
