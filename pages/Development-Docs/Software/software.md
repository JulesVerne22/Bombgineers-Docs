# Software Docs
For the software development, the main thing to realize is that the entirety of the simulation was built in Unreal Engine 4 (besides firmware for the hardware which is expanded on in [hardware](../Hardware/hardware.md)). Important documentation pieces to get up an running with the simulation are:
- [Setup](setup.md): what was used for developer environment
- [Future Development](future-development.md): things to add that we can think of when the documentation was made
- [Blueprints](blueprints.md): what blueprints were made and what is inside them (i.e. functionality and variables)
- [Macro Library](vyns-macro-library.md): additional macros that needed to be made
