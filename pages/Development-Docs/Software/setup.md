# Software Setup
## Building the game
For a comprehensive guide on how to build the game, visit [Unreal Docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/Basics/Projects/Packaging/).

Please note that to build, you will need Visual Studio. We used the 2019 Community Version.

## Version control
We used Perforce when developing the game as it tends to work well with large files. Since our game has massive binary files, Perforce ended up working better for us than git. Additionally, merge conflicts in git with the binary files generated by unreal quickly became a nightmare.

For downloading Perforce, visit [Helix Client](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix-visual-client-p4v).
